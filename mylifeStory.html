    <h1>Shibiru Ararso</h1>


    <p>

        First of all, thanks to you Professor Rakish, because you are providing me an excellent chance to speak about
        myself., my name is Shibiru Alemayehu Ararso and I am 27 years old. Originally I am from Ethiopia, Africa, in
        east-central Africa. Ethiopia bordered on the west by Sudan, the east by Somalia and Djibouti, the south by
        Kenya, and the northeast by Eritrea. I have two brothers and two sisters except me. It means we are five,
        including me. My father is a farmer where as my mother is a good housewife. Before I left Ethiopia we all live
        happily with our parents. From grade one to eight, I go to school by walking that is far from our home 45
        minutes. The place I was born and grew up, there is no transportation. Always I reach school at the exact time.
        From grades 9 to 12 we rent the house in the city with my friends and attend our class until we finished.

        After I finished my 12 grade, I start to apply to a very large university. From all I applied, I chose to go to
        the most largest university because I like being part of a diverse student body. Ethiopia there is too many
        ethnic groups that speak a different language. So at that time, I wish I can study my major with that
        student....
